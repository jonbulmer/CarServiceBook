Factory Pattern

A pattern used to simplify object creation

Creating different objects based on need.

Repository creation. 


To demostrate the factory pattern I am going to add a 
userRepository.js and a
projectRepository.js

The first thing we are going to do is run this project th old way with out 
the factory pattern.

So we are pulling in 3 repositories and it is a little bit of a mess.

Now we are going to use the factory pattern to replace lines 2 to 4.
So a factory repository creates the the repositories for us and we don't have to change 
main.js every time we add a database or some other function.

We create a repoFactory.js

This is a simple Factory with our repositories in it.
The function takes a string with the repostory type and then check for the require
we want and returns our require the the mainSimpleFactory.js

Noe we can return the require from the factory when we call a new serviceBook
and give use a user or project based on what we are asking for. 

We only have the following require.
var repoFactory = require('./repoFactory');
