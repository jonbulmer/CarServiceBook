Factory Pattern

A pattern used to simplify object creation

Creating different objects based on need.

Repository creation. 


To demostrate the factory pattern I am going to add a 
userRepository.js and a
projectRepository.js

The first thing we are going to do is run this project th old way with out 
the factory pattern.

So we are pulling in 3 repositories and it is a little bit of a mess.
