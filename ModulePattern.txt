Start to put together my notes.


Simulate database methods
Module Patten Nodejs

create a get method for the database object.
Then in the main.js instancate a new task with
the database object as the params.
We use a JSon object as the params.
In the database module create a save method and
save this the module the when we instancate the
module we pass the parms as a JSon object
var Db = new DbModual({'name':'John Smith','registration': 'T8' });
Inside the DbModule we create
var db = {};
Because of the way javasript closures work every db call encasulates db
into the module and we don't have to wory about database connections in
our code eles where in the application.

Use the reveling mudule patten

Every time we goto the module in code we can see the methods in the dot
notation in the API. This modual has a method and nextMethod methods

var Module = function () {
var privateVar = 'I am private...';

var method = function () {...
}

var nextMethod = function () {...
}

return{
  method: method,
  nextMethod: nextmethod;
  }
}
